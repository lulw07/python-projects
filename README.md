# Python Projects

I have created this repo to always keep track of my knowledge of the Python programming language.

I will start by building simple projects like scissors-stone-paper or a simple calculator.

After that, more and more challenging tasks will follow.

## Software and other Python Packages

I use PyCharm from JetBrains because I am a student and got the complete JetBrains package for free.


In my Python code I often use [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) as a GUI. I can only highly recommend it, it is easy to integrate and is also used worldwide.

## Permissions

You are very welcome to use the code. It is written by myself and definitely needs improvement.
